```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


To download a font in your project, use outside of your Rmd document :

```{r demo-setup_font, eval=FALSE}
setup_font(
  id = "kiwi-maru",
  output_dir = "assets"
)
```

`assets/` is a sub-folder where the Rmd is located.


Then use use a chunk like this one to import your font into your RMarkdown document :

`````````r
`r ''````{r ex-use_font, results='asis'}
gfonts::use_font("indie-flower", "assets/css/indie-flower.css")
```
`````````


```{r ex-use_font-bis, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
gfonts::use_font("kiwi-maru", "assets/css/kiwi-maru.css", css = "font-family: 'Kiwi Maru', serif;")
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
